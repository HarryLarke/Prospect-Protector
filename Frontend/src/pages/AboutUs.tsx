                    Recently established in 2025, by our founder Harry Larke. There had been a growing discontention with popular CRM's, due to their untuitatiave UI, slow systems and high prices.
                    The monopoly of these CRMs had resulted in a stagnation, which little no innovation going on at all. Prospector Protector was built to address to the market needs, particularly for 
                    those business who did such require such bulky CRMs.
                    Prospect Protector, is therefore the opposite of its big brothers: fast, lightweight and intuitive. This CRM not only provides an effecrtive service, but is a joy to use.
