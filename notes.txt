    Goals:  Working on server side, will need a of cleaning, then will create a basic frontend to login to.
            Here will also start working on my SQL DB, populating it with usere info! 
            Eseentially, get the whole stack working and communicating before, continue this project!!  
    Timescale: This willl probably take me around 8 hours to complete.

        Progress: Welp, I've built out some of the fronted fror RTK, mainly on the auth side. Things appear to run in dev, with my queries
                and auth set up.
        Goals: Now I'm coming back to the server and adding some of the verification middleware. After that I will begin to structure and 
                popalate my DB!!!! I plan to keep relatively basic for and I might event strip some thing back off my sever just to get things
                running.  
        Timescale: 4 to 8 hours.
        Additional notes: wish me luck!

	Progress: So backend and frontend are now communicating, with user reg now working! 
	
	Goals: Well, need to do some work with routing or pop up to show the success/outcome of 	the reg .
	Additionally, would like to get my auth/login sorted too! This will require some work on 	
	both the back and frontend alike. But, the actual code is written, just needs 	            	calibrating for mySQL Db. 
	Timescale: 6 hours.
