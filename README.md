Hello and welcome to another full-stack project!

The aim of this project is to use SQL DB to store a lot of relational data, in this case referring to clients and prospects. 
The other aim is to use and apply secure login and logout skills using JWT's and Refresh Tokens. 

The actual project is essentially a basic CRM tool. The reason why I chose such a tool, is CRM's require security, scability and utilise SQL DB's.  

PLEASE NOTE: This project is still in its' early stages of devlopment! I aim to keep chipping away at this project over the next few months! 
            If you want to checkout my day-to-day work and progress have a look at the notes.txt. 

Thanks,  
Harry
